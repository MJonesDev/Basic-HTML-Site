# Basic-HTML-Site
This simple HTML website was made for my CS392 class (Special Topics - Mobile App Development) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
The code is open sourced with permission of the professor, as it could prove helpful to some learning HTML. The code demonstrates basic use of headings, paragraphs, images, unordered lists, and more. This is a raw document and shows no design whatsoever, and is just for the purpose of learning.
