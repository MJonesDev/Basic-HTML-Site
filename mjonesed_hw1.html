  Hey! I'm <a href = "https://github.com/MJonesDev">Marlon Jones</a>, a Graphic
  Designer, Programmer, and tech enthusiest that loves to make things for
  Android, drink coffee, and play League of legends.
   This is just a simple webpage that demonstrates some uses of
  HTML tags, and what they do. Some of these include paragraphs, images, and
  more. This webpage has also been open sourced (with permission from the
  professor, of course) to
  <a href = "https://github.com/MJonesDev/Basic-HTML-Site">GitHub</a>
   to be used to
  help others learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Now enjoy this gif from
  Kamikaze Douga's <i>Pop Team Epic</i>.
